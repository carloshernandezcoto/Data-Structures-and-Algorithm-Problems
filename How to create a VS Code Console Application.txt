How to create a VS Code console application?


Prerequisites:
- Install VS Code.
- Instal .Net Core SDK 5 or above.

Open a Windows cmd
cd C:\Users\carlosh\Documents\Code\AlgorithmSolutions (go to the folder where you want to create the app)
dotnet new console -o myApp   (creates a new folder with an application called "myApp")
cd myApp (go to the newly created application)
code . (open the app with VS Code)
dotnet restore (resolves the dependencies of the project and gives you access to the required .NET Core packages that are needed to build the project)
modify the "launch.json" file and add the following line for using an external console if you want:
	"console": "externalTerminal",
VS Code will show this message: "Required assets to build and debug are missing from 'myApp'. Add them?" (Click yes)
Press F5 and start debugging your program
